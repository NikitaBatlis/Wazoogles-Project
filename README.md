# Wazoogles-Project
### Personal project to redesign the Wazoogles.com online store.

I have been following the Wazoogles brand for some time now, and while they have very strong visual and graphic design -they outgrew their Shopify template
store long ago. 

With this in mind, I based my *first **e-commerce** project* on their brand.

**My main goal for this project was to:**
* Improve the overall design aesthetic and flow of the site, 
* Improve conversion rates for purchases and subscriptions,

**I aimed to achieve this through:**
* well executed UX, 
* bold visual call to actions, 
* responsive UI with optimized images for seamless desktop to mobile usage.
                                
**All while maintaining Wazoogles playful and natural brand identity.**

# Installation
1. Download the zip of all the files in this repository. 
2. Create the following folders with these *exact names* and move the following files into these folders: 

    * **html** - then move all the .html files in here *EXCEPT* '*Index.html*'
    * **css** - then move all the .css files into here.
    * **js** - move all the .js files in here.
    * **images** - move all the .jpeg and .png  files in this folder. Furthermore, create this folder within the 'images' folder:
      * **Icons** - move '*icons8-search-25.png*' and '*shopping-cart-25-0.png*' into this folder.

3. Once this files structure is correct, open '*Index.html*'
